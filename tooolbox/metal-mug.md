Soils with high clay content create planting and maintenance challenges for gardeners. Generally, soils that contain greater than 30% clay are considered unacceptable as topsoil material because soils with high clay content slow water infiltration and air penetration. Clay soils can be difficult for roots to penetrate, and can be very hard for gardeners to cultivate. Gardeners with clay soils may choose to bring in an alternative soil and garden in raised bed boxes, or amend existing clay soil with loamy topsoil or well-composted organic matter. The city of Pittsburgh and its neighborhood Lawrenceville, is a massive pile of clay.

Clay is a good foundation for gardening, but it makes urban gardening a challenge. You want to break up the soil -- arating it to provide nooks and crannies for sands and organic matter to mix in with that wad of mud. What you don't want to do is to add _more_ clay to your garden. I've added about 30 ounces of clay to my soil in the form of cracked coffee mugs to my garden.

Gardening and coffee go hand in hand. A big French press follows me as I flitter about the garden, avoiding the sun then reveling in it as I spend my Saturday mornings out in the yard.

- Clay soil is crappy
- Soil compaction
- Broken Coffee mugs through the garden
- Doesn't stop me I love my French Press
- French press grounds inject the nitrogen I need
- This is a lie I tell myself, I really need way more than the ~1.5oz at a time
- found a camping mug at the local thrift store
- Haven't looked back with that mug. To the office, it travels with me
- Coffee seasoning but it's stainless so hot water and we're G2G
