# Welcome to my plant-based tracker!

## I'm a big fan of spreadsheets for marking out where I want to put all of my plants

I'm going to upload my historical trackers here, and I've also been tinkering with a side project that I'd like to get going that will allow me to do some really flexible tracking of garden productivity. Stay tuned!

## Our story so far
:potted_plant: :potted_plant: :potted_plant: :potted_plant: :potted_plant:

Since the pandemic I've been using spreadsheets to track my garden. It's mostly a rectangle and most of my useable yard is North-West facing. I've been lucky in being able to grow all kinds of funky fruits and veg in the yard

# Without a doubt I've been most obsessed with my CORN

## Native Plants

I'd really really like to grow a small amount of fruits and veg a year and dedicate most of the yard to growing native plants. The dream is for a sufficient amount of pawpaw trees to produce fruit. _BUT_ we're a long way off from there.
