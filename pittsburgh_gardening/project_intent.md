# Our goal here is simple: programatically come up with a creative way to lay out my backyard garden.

## Some of the parameters we'll want to feed in include ratio of produce-to-pollinator, and historical garden layout data.

### Layering in some information on what crops we _could_ grow in Pittsburgh, I'll allow for some human input and the program will return if the human-designed garden is valid. If you're in a pinch and there's a really good seed sale, we can also generate a garden.

# Rules for a valid garden

1. First, we need to know if the plants I'm looking to use will even stand a _chance_ in the irradiated hellscape that can be growing inside of a city, let alone Pittsburgh.
2. Second, crop rotation is a must. Never again will I let pumpkin weavels gorge themselves after a second season of gourds. Also, the soil is fragile, even though I think it looks cool I can't grow corn everywhere.
3. We're always biasing towards native plants. Not only native, but also native plants the *pollinators* love. Because we love the bees here.
4. We're _aesthetic_ creatures here. Where possible, put some rules in place so tall plants are behind ground cover/we don't go crazy and put vines on the inside and tomato plants that require smooshing other plants to get to far away -- that sort of thing
