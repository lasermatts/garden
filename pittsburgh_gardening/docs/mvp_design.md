# MVP Design: AI-Powered Smart Garden Planner

## Objective

Build a functional, lightweight, and visually compelling MVP that can generate smart garden layouts with minimal setup. The goal is to get something running locally or on AWS Lightsail in just a few days, delivering a "this is dope as fuck" experience that showcases the power of AI-assisted gardening.

## Core MVP Features

1. Simple Web App Interface

Frontend: Lightweight web app (React or Svelte for speed)

Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Flask for quick setup

Deployment: Run locally or on AWS Lightsail

2. AI-Generated Garden Layouts

User inputs:

Garden size (drag-to-resize grid or enter dimensions)

Preferred produce-to-pollinator ratio

Must-have plants (user selects from a dropdown)

Sunlight conditions (full sun, partial, shade)

System generates:

Optimal plant placements (avoiding shade issues, maximizing yield)

Basic crop rotation awareness (warns about consecutive same-crop placement)

Simple aesthetic rules (keeps tall plants in back, ensures paths are accessible)

3. Quick Garden Validation

Does this layout make sense? AI checks if the garden is:

Climate-compatible (uses Pittsburgh climate data as a test case)

Pollinator-friendly (flags gardens with poor pollinator diversity)

Rotationally sound (warns about overuse of soil nutrients)

4. Downloadable & Shareable Layouts

Export as PNG or simple JSON file for saving plans

Quick copy-to-clipboard garden summary (text format for sharing)

Tech Stack (Keep it Lean & Fast)

Component

Tech Choice

Frontend

React + Tailwind OR Svelte

Backend

FastAPI (Python) OR Flask

Database

SQLite (for MVP, migrate to PostgreSQL later)

AI/Logic

Simple rules engine + OpenAI API (for quick prototyping)

Hosting

Local OR AWS Lightsail (Docker container for easy deploy)

## Stretch Goals (If Time Allows)

‚úÖ Basic AR Preview Mode - Overlay garden on real space via WebAR
‚úÖ Seed Sale Integration - Pull real-time seed sales and auto-optimize layout
‚úÖ Gamification - Assign a simple Garden Score‚Ñ¢Ô∏è based on optimization

## Deployment Plan

Day 1 ‚Äì Set up repo, scaffold basic web app, test FastAPI

Day 2 ‚Äì Implement AI layout logic, generate visual grid

Day 3 ‚Äì Add climate & pollinator validation + simple export

Day 4 ‚Äì Deploy on AWS Lightsail, refine UI, show off! üéâ

## Definition of Success

‚úÖ User enters garden size + a few plant choices
‚úÖ AI generates a visually sound garden layout
‚úÖ System validates if the layout makes sense
‚úÖ Exportable and deployed live on AWS Lightsail

Boom. MVP Done. üöÄ
