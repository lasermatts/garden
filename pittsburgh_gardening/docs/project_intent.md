# AI-Powered Smart Garden Planner

## Project Intent

Our goal here is simple: programmatically generate a **beautiful, functional, and ecologically sound** layout for a backyard garden using AI-driven optimization.

## Core Features

### **1. AI-Assisted Aesthetic Layout Generator**
- The system intelligently arranges plants based on **height, color, accessibility, and aesthetics** to create a **visually stunning yet practical** garden.
- Uses **style-based preferences** so you can guide the AI (e.g., "cottage garden," "formal symmetry," "wild meadow").
- Ensures that **tall plants** donâ€™t block access and vines donâ€™t strangle nearby crops.

### **2. Crop Rotation & Pest Prevention Modeling**
- AI analyzes **historical garden layout data** and **prevents pest buildup** by ensuring a proper rotation cycle.
- Includes **companion planting strategies** (e.g., basil next to tomatoes to deter pests).

### **3. Dynamic "What If" Scenario Planning**
- Allows users to **test different layouts** before planting.
- "What happens if I add more pollinator plants?" The system **recalculates biodiversity impact** and adjusts recommendations accordingly.

### **4. Sunlight & Microclimate Analysis**
- Uses a **seasonal light tracker** to ensure optimal placement based on **sun exposure and shade mapping**.
- Accounts for **urban heat islands, wind tunnels, and soil temperature fluctuations**.

### **5. Smart Soil & Plant Health Monitoring**
- Integrates with **soil sensors** (or allows manual input) to **recommend plant choices** based on available nutrients.
- Provides **seasonal care reminders** and **real-time adjustments** if soil conditions change.

### **6. Gamified "Garden Score" & Challenges**
- Assigns a **Garden Optimization Score** based on biodiversity, pollination support, aesthetics, and productivity.
- Offers **seasonal challenges** like "Best Winter Garden" or "Maximum Pollinator Attraction."

### **7. AI-Powered Seed Sale Optimization**
- If there's a seed sale, the AI generates a **new garden plan** incorporating sale items **without breaking long-term rotation rules**.

### **8. Augmented Reality (AR) Garden Preview**
- Hold up your phone and see a **real-time overlay of your planned garden**.
- Adjust placements in **AR before planting**.

### **9. Foraging & Edible Landscapes Mode**
- Suggests **wild edibles** that blend seamlessly into the garden (e.g., wild strawberries, Jerusalem artichokes).

## Rules for a Valid Garden
1. **Climate Compatibility**: Plants must be able to survive **Pittsburghâ€™s urban microclimate**.
2. **Crop Rotation**: Avoids planting the same crop in the same area **two seasons in a row**.
3. **Pollinator Bias**: Native plants and flowers that attract **bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds** are given priority.
4. **Aesthetic Principles**: Ensures **tall plants donâ€™t shade smaller ones**, vines donâ€™t block pathways, and accessibility is maintained.

## Future Expansion
- Integration with **automated irrigation and weeding robots**.
- **Community-sharing features** where users can upload, rate, and exchange garden layouts.
- AI-generated **seasonal garden updates** that suggest optimal replanting times.

This isnâ€™t just a **garden layout tool**â€”itâ€™s a **next-gen AI-driven gardening experience** that makes planning, planting, and maintaining a garden **intelligent, fun, and beautiful**. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
